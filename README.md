#Installation: 

To run the game you have 2 different options:

1-Open the following link :  https://danielvillacanas.github.io/BalloonFight/

2-Clone the repo with node.js installed at your computer and open the index.html file.

#Instructions:

- The game duration is 2 minutes, and the main idea is to obtain a bigger score than the other player.

- To gain point you have to shoot the balloons with the same color as the background and avoid that the balloons hit you.

- If you fail and you shoot a balloon with a different color, you will lose 1 point and if a balloon hits you you will lose 3 points.

- To make the game a little bit more diffficult we have added 2 things, special balloons and bonuses. 

- The special balloons are similar to normal balloons but the main different is that their color can be different to the background color and if they hit the floor
the background color will change to the color of the special balloon.

- The bonuses are addons that introduce new mechanics to the game, we have 7 different bonuses:

1. PartyHard : That bonus increase the number of balloons and reduces the appearing interval of the balloons
2. Self-Freeze : If you hit a self freeze bonus your character will not be allow during 10 seconds.
3. Slow : If you hit that bonus your character will move slower.
4. PointsX2 : If you hit a balloon your score will increase by 2 instead of 1.
5. FastMove : If you hit that bonus your speed will increase
6. Freeze other : If you hit that bonus you will freeze the other player preventing him from moving.
7. Shield : If you hit that bonus balloons hit will not affect you.
